			<p>While the idea of growing plants on Mars seems like such an amazing one, it would be rather
				difficult to grow plants on Mars. The reaso for this is because how much further away from the
				sun Mars is. Mars is about 50 million miles further away from the sun than planet Earth. This
				makes it much harder for plants to get the proper amount of sunlight they need in order to grow. 
				This doesn't mean that it is impossible, but it would require much more work to get the seeds
				to sprout and grown into adult plants. Things that we would need in order to get these plants 
				to grow are, soil, water, light, heat, air, and nitrogen. Yes I know it seems like a lot,
				but that doesn't mean it is impossible. 
					The best plant to try to grow first would be Bamboo, Bamboo doesn't require as much
				nutients as other plants and the conditions of Mars wouldn't really affect a Bamboo tree. So
				in time hopefully there will be plant life on Mars! </p>
